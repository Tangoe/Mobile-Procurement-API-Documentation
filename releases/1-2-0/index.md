# Release 1.2.0

## New Features

### Device Upgrade Eligiblity Tracking
Properties were added to help to determine when a service asset is eligible for a device upgrade. The **upgradeEligibilityDate** property was added to responses that contain a service asset. Responses containing the employee object now include the **updated** property. And the **dateTimeUpdatedOnOrAfter** filter parameter was added to the **/employees** endpoint.
