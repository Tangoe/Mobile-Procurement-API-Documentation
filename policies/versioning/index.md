# Versioning Policy   * **DRAFT (TO BE APPROVED BY LEGAL)** *

Tangoe supports multiple versions of our APIs to enable introduction of new features without disrupting use by third-party consumers. Moreover, we provide ample notice to those existing consumers so that they can make appropriate plans for migrating to the latest version. *(Please Note: APIs are subject to change without prior notice if a security vulnerability is discovered in the current functionality.)*

## Version Numbers and Backwards Compatibility
New/expanded functionality may be added at any time but the version number will not change. Backwards compatibility will be maintained and API consumers can continue to use it without modification to their code. The API version number will only be incremented when a breaking change is introduced. At this time, all older versions of the API will be considered deprecated. 

## Deprecation Policy
Although deprecated versions of the API will continue to be supported for a limited time, they are no longer actively maintained. As soon as a version is deemed deprecated, consumers of that API version should begin taking steps to upgrade to the current/active version. 

Every version of the API is guaranteed to remain supported for at least **one year** from the date that a newer version is released. **After one year, deprecated API versions may no longer work properly and could be retired at any time.**

## Retirement
APIs that are marked as retired may no longer work properly and should no longer be relied upon. Moreover, these obsolete versions can be removed at any time and therefore should not be used.
