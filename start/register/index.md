# Register your Application

[TO BE DISCUSSED WITH BECKY -- NEED TO DETERMINE HOW WE WANT THEM TO REGISTER]


To begin using this API, you need to register your application with Tangoe. Please contact us at:  XXXXXXX@tangoe.com  [*** ASK BECKY FOR CONTACT EMAIL -- OR, USE SALESFORCE FORM? (pardot.com) ***]. 

Once your application is registered, a client ID and client secret will be provided. This ID and secret are used to obtain a personalized access token that must be passed with every API call. 

Next, simply follow our easy tutorial to see how you can <a href="/start/first-call/">make your first call in just minutes</a>.
